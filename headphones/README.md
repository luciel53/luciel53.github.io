# Implement a design from scratch


In this project, you will implement from scratch, without any library, a web page. You will use all HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design knowledges that you learned previously.

You won’t have a lot of instruction, you are free to implement it the way that you want - the objective is simple: Have a fully functional web page that looks the same as the designer file.

Here the final result:

This webpage has been designed by Nicolas Philippot, UI/UX designer. You can find final screens [here](https://intranet-projects-files.s3.amazonaws.com/holbertonschool-webstack/622/Archive.zip)

### Requirements

+ you are not allowed to import external CSS framework (like Bootstrap)
+ you are not to use Javascript

## Tasks

### 0. Read and be familiar with Figma

Create an account in [Figma](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/y6_o1T-HtCyTAGuOJqdA_g) and open this [project](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/SpYRV14tPxTZJSjU2Eoh4A) and “Duplicate to your Drafts” to have access to all design details.

If you can’t access to it, please find here the [Figma file](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/tWEPFyHyXyNO9Xfi2Er2EA)

Important notes with Figma:

- if your computer doesn’t have missing fonts, you can find them here: [source-sans-pro](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/yvx4-XkjAQJgHlN6RAoKWQ) and [Spin-Cycle-OT](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/Jw0FKYKB6l5_2Koto0duTA)
- some values are in float - feel free to round them

For this task, please write an amazing `README.md`

**Interactions note:**

- the web page must switch to the mobile version when the screen width is 480px or less
- links hover/active: `#FF6565`
    button hover/active: `opacity: 0.9`
    max width of the content: 1000px centered in the page

**Repo:**

- GitHub repository: `holbertonschool-headphones`
- File: `README.md`


### 1. Header

Building a web page the right way, is not easy - expect if you put in place strong foundations:

+ reset CSS styling
+ use variables
+ simple/“as generic as you can” CSS selectors
+ avoid using super specific CSS selectors as much as possible
+ simple HTML structure - `div` containers are your friend!

Last advice: Personally, I always start to build a web page from outside to inside and from top to bottom. But you can try to other way - it’s fine - but you should structure the way that you will implement a component and not get lost with HTML tags.

Now, your turn!

For this first task: **create the header/hero piece**

Here an archive of all assets needed: [images_.zip](https://s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/hbtn.intranet/uploads/misc/2020/3/d1597894d79386c83b9b.zip?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIA4MYA5JM5DUTZGMZG%2F20230826%2Feu-west-3%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20230826T150001Z&X-Amz-Expires=345600&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=9e128806acc2674029b9c14ac55cbc8b7ba547614eef0e3ad52c5bddee60be74)

+ File: `0-index.html`, `0-styles.css`


### 2. "What we do..." section

Copy files from the previous task.

For this second task: **create the “What we do…” section**

In this section, you will need custom font icons. Here the archive of it: holberton_school-icon.zip Inside you will find demo page of how to use it.

**Important:** try to build as generic as you can… you will probably need some components in next section.

**Repo:**

- GitHub repository: `holbertonschool-headphones`
- File: `1-index.html`, `1-styles.css`


### 3. "Our results" section

Copy files from the previous task.

For this third task: `create the “Our results” section`

Now you can reuse components form the previous task!

**Repo:**

+ GitHub repository: `holbertonschool-headphones`
+ File: `2-index.html`, `2-styles.css`


### 4. Contact us

Copy files from the previous task.

A good landing page has always a contact form.

You are free to add any animations and/or constraints on fields.

**Repo:**

- GitHub repository: `holbertonschool-headphones`
- File: `3-index.html`, `3-styles.css`


### 5. Footer
